      Include reference assemblies to compile against the current MTGO version.

      We optionally disable copying reference assemblies to the output directory
      when specifying `Private="false"`. This tells the compiler that the GAC
      will provide the assemblies instead, and to only use the reference
      assemblies for compilation and not include them as part of the package.

      Instead, consumers of the SDK will generate their own reference assemblies
      using transitive build targets provided by the `MTGOSDK.MSBuild` project.
