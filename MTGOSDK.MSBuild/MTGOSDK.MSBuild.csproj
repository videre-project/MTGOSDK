      These lines pack the build props/targets files to the `build` and
      `buildTransitive` folders in the generated package. By convention, the
      .NET SDK will look for build\<packageId>.props and build\<packageId>.targets
      for automatic inclusion in the build.

      The `build` folder is for the props/targets files that are directly
      imported by the consuming project. The `buildTransitive` folder is for
      the props/targets files that are imported by any upstream consumers.
